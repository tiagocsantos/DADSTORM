%% The following commands can be sent by a PuppetMaster to the stream processing nodes:
%%  Start OPERATOR_ID: tells the OPERATOR_ID operator to start processing tuples.
%%  Interval OPERATOR_ID X ms: the operator should sleep X milliseconds between consecutive events.
%%  Status: make all nodes in the system to print its current status.
%%  Crash OPERATOR_ID REP_ID: force a process, i.e. a replica of an operator, to crash. 
%%  Freeze OPERATOR_ID REP_ID: after receiving Freeze, the proecess continues receiving messages but stops processing them.
%%  Unfreeze OPERATOR_ID REP_ID: a frozen process is back to normal execution. It processes all previous pended messages.
%%  Wait x ms : This command instructs the pupper master to sleep for x milliseconds before reading and executing the following command in the script file.
